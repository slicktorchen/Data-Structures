DESCRIPTION OF 3RD STATISTIC:
The third statistic calculates the number of tiebreak wins and losses for each player and calculates the percentage
of tiebreaker wins when a player plays tiebreaker games. A tiebreak game is identified if one of the number of games won or lost
in a set is equal to 7. If a player has never played a tiebreak game, then a percentage is unable to be calculated and "N/A" is printed instead.
